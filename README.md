## Goal

This project aims to demonstrate how to make a
production [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) app
with [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/).

## Requirements

* IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio / Fleet, with Android SDK
* XCode 15.4 for the iOS app

## Setup

Create the file `local.properties` after cloning the project to be able to compile/run

```properties
sdk.dir=<Path to Android SDK>
tmdb.api.key=<Your TMDB API Key>
```

On MacOS, your Android SDK is probably located at `/Users/<user>/Library/Android/sdk`.

## Run

### Android

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio or Fleet and run the generated run configuration.

### iOS

Open the XCode project using XCode 15.4 and run the target.

### JVM / Desktop

Run gradle task `desktopRun` from your IDE or terminal:

```bash
./gradlew desktopRun
```

## Release

To release a new version of the app, make sure you're on the `develop` git branch then run one of the following
commands:

```bash
# Release (will use current -SNAPSHOT version number) then increment fix number for subsequent snapshots
./release.sh
```

```bash
# Release with a specific version number, then increment fix number for subsequent snapshots
# Use this to release a new minor or major version
./release.sh 1.2.3
```

The script will automatically run the release process:

- New Gitflow release with the appropriate name
- Changes to `build.gradle.kts` and XCode project
- Commits to various branches
- Backmerge into `develop`

You should be immediately ready to continue working on the project after running the release script.
